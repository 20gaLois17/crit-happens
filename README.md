## About
This project is a fork from the original oforge-core project.
Oforge is a highly modular online portal, 
that can be easily customized or extended, based on customer needs.

(Info 10/2022):
I used the oforge core to bootstrap a guild page in late 2019 shortly after the release of Classic WoW.
As soon as I got bored with WoW (which did not take too long), I started to focus more on the guild page and implemented a couple of features. For some months, this guild page was a passion project of mine - as the site had about 70 active guild members at that time. Some of the implemented features where:
 - Loot tables -> Guild Members could declare need in advance
 - DKP Overview
 - Registration for Raid Nights -> automatic generation of a Raid-Roaster 24h before a raid
 - ... 
Looking at the code now, I would have done things differently, but much time has passed and I don't feel too ashamed anymore to make this repo public ;)

## The Core
The core is based on the Slim PHP micro framework and the well-proven Doctrine project.
